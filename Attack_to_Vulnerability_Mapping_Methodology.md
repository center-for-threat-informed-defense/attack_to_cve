# Methodology for Mapping MITRE ATT&CK Techniques to Vulnerabilities 
The number of vulnerabilities being reported is overwhelming.  Defenders need help processing vulnerability reports.  Standardizing the data in vulnerability reports makes it easier for defenders to interpret the report quickly and accurately.  It also enables automation since computers have an even harder time understanding the variations in terminology than humans.  This document provides a methodology that can be used to help standardize the way vulnerabilities are reported by using MITRE ATT&CK.

##	What is ATT&CK? 
[ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The knowledge base represents adversary goals as tactics and the specific behaviors to achieve those goals as techniques and sub-techniques. Through its global adoption, ATT&CK has become a common taxonomy for both offense and defense to understand and communicate about adversary behaviors. ATT&CK is widely used as a foundation for threat models and a critical input into many cybersecurity disciplines to convey threat intelligence. 

ATT&CK can provide a method for standardizing the language around vulnerabilities. ATT&CK techniques provide a standard way of describing the methods adversaries use to exploit a vulnerability and what adversaries hope to achieve by exploiting the vulnerability. Using ATT&CK techniques to describe a vulnerability makes it easier for defenders integrating vulnerabilities into their threat modeling and risk management practices.

## Using ATT&CK to Describe Vulnerabilities

ATT&CK provides a standard method for describing the exploitation process of a vulnerability.  For example, to exploit a vulnerability where credentials are sent in clear text, the following step could be used:
1. Sniff the newtork ([T1040](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040/))
2. Which gets you the unsecured credentials ([T1552](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/))
3. Which you can use to access a valid account ([T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/))

Once the attacker has access to the valid account, there are too many paths they can take to list them all.  When developing this methodology, we found that three steps in the attack is usually as far in the process as can be reasonably described.  We categorize the step in the following way:
1. **Exploitation Technique** - the method used to exploit the vulnerability (T1040 in the example).
2. **Primary Impact** - the initial benefit gained through exploitation of a vulnerability. (T1552 in the example)
3. **Secondary Impact** - what the adversary can do by gaining the benefit of the primary impact (T1078 in the example).

Using these three categories, you can create a description tempalte such as:

> The vulnerability allows the attacker to use **[EXPLOITATION TECHNIQUE]** to gain **[Primary Impact]**, which leads to **[Secondary Impact]**.

##	Using the Methodology

### Mapping Methods
There are three methods used to map ATT&CK techniques to vulnerabilities:

-	[**Vulnerability Type**](Attack_to_Vulnerability_Mapping_Methodology.md#vulnerability-type-mappings) – This method groups vulnerabilities with common vulnerability types (e.g., cross-site scripting and SQL injection) that have common technique mappings.  For vulnerability types that don’t have common technique mappings, the other methods are used.
-	[**Functionality**](Attack_to_Vulnerability_Mapping_Methodology.md#functionality) - This method groups common mappings based on the type of functionality the attacker gains access to by exploiting the vulnerability.
-	[**Exploit Techniques**](Attack_to_Vulnerability_Mapping_Methodology.md#exploitation-techniques) – This method groups common mappings depending on the method used to exploit the vulnerability.

Only the vulnerability type method has mappings for all three categories.  The functionality method has mappings for primary and secondary impacts and the exploit techniques method (as the name implies) only has mappings for the exploitation technique categories.


### Mapping
Just because a method could include mappings for more than one category, does not mean that it will in all instances.  It all depends on how likely different vulnerabilities in the group share that technique.  For example, vulnerabilities that modify memory (e.g., buffer overflows) share a common primary impact, but the secondary impacts and exploitation techniques are so varied that the methodology does not include a mapping for those categories.  Also, some groupings will have more than one technique listed for a mapping category because there are some common variations within that grouping.  In these cases, only the techniques that apply to the vulnerability should be selected.  For example, the cross-site scripting (XSS) group includes an option of [T1189](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189) (Drive-by Compromise) or [T1204.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001) (User Execution: Malicious Link) depending on whether the attacked is stored or not.

### Example

[**CVE-2018-17900**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-17900)

> Yokogawa STARDOM Controllers FCJ, FCN-100, FCN-RTU, FCN-500, All versions R4.10 and prior, The web application improperly protects credentials which could allow an attacker to obtain credentials for remote access to controllers.

To find the appropriate ATT&CK techniques, start by identifying the vulnerability type.  For CVE-2018-17900, the vulnerability is a credential management issue.  Looking through the list of vulnerability types in the methodology, the "General Credential Management Errors" group appears to be the most appropriate.  Using one of the lower-level credential management vulnerability types is preferable but the CVE record does not provide the level of detail need to do so.  

The ”General Credential Management Errors” vulnerability type map to [T1552](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552) (Unsecure Credentials) for the primary impact and [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) (Valid Accounts) for the secondary impact.  These mappings follow the description in the CVE record.  “improperly protects credentials which could allow an attacker to obtain credentials” matches T1552 and “for remote access to controllers” matches T1078.

The ”General Credential Management Errors” vulnerability type does not have a mapping for the exploitation technique because there are too many ways general credential management vulnerabilities can be exploited.  To find the exploitation technique for CVE-2018-17900, use the Exploit Technique section.  The Exploit Technique section documents a set of scenarios to help the user determine which exploitation technique(s) are appropriate for the vulnerability.  For CVE-2018-17900, the entry point is the web application so the “Attacker exploits remote system application” scenario applies, which makes [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190) (Exploit Public-Facing Application) the exploitation technique for the vulnerability.

The description for CVE-2018-17900 can now be re-written using the ATT&CK standard.
> Yokogawa STARDOM Controllers FCJ, FCN-100, FCN-RTU, FCN-500, All versions R4.10 and prior, have Unsecure Credentials which could allow an attacker to gain access to Valid Accounts by Exploiting the Public-Facing Application.


##	Limitations
The methodology is not meant to be a 100% solution and cannot cover all the various way systems are exploited. It is meant as an easy-to-use starting point for vulnerability reporters to standardize the way they describe some vulnerability data.

# Tactic-level Techniques

For many tactics within ATT&CK, there is a generic exploitation technique.  When mapping techniques to vulnerabilities, exploitation can be assumed so these techniques are not as useful in this context than for other uses of ATT&CK.  In this document, where possible, a more specific technique is used over the generic exploitation techniques. 

| Tactic | Generic Exploitation Technique |
| ---- | ---- |
| Initial Access | T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) |
| Execution | T1203 (Exploitation of Client Execution) |
| Privilege Escalation | T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation) |
| Defense Evasion | T1211 (Exploitation for Defense Evasion) |
| Credential Access | T1212 (Exploitation for Credential Access) |
| Lateral Movement | T1210 (Exploitation of Remote Services) |

#	Vulnerability type mappings

# Examples

## CVE-2020-6960

[CVE-2020-6960](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6960) is a SQL injection vulnerability.  The SQL injection listing the Vulnerability Type section contains mappings for the Primary Impact and Secondary Impact.  For the Primary Impact, the mapping is [T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059) (Command and Scripting Interpreter).  For the Secondary Impact, there are several options to choose from.  Unfortunately, the CVE record does not provide enough information to choose a Secondary Impact.

## CVE-2018-17900

[CVE-2018-17900](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17900) is about insecure credential handling.  The in "General Credential Management Errors" grouping applies for this vulnerability.  In this case, both mappings in the methodology apply.  The Primary Impact is [T1552](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552) (Unsecure Credentials), when then leads to the Secondary Impact allowing the adversary to use [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) (Valid Accounts).

## CVE-2020-11036

[CVE-2020-11036](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11036) is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.  For XSS vulnerabilities, there are standard Primary Impact and Secondary Impact mappings (T1059.007 and T1185 respectively).  However, the Exploitation Technique depends on what type of XSS vulnerability it is.  Since CVE-2020-11036 is a stored XSS vulnerability, the mapping should be [T1189](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189) (Drive-by Compromise), as the attack is stored in the web page and the victims are attacked by visiting the infected web page.

## CVE-2020-5210

[CVE-2020-5210](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5210) is a buffer overflow.  Since buffer overflows modify the memory, the "Memory Modification (Memory Buffer Errors, Pointer Issues, Type Errors, etc.)" grouping is used, making the Primary Impacts [T1574](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574) (Hijack Execution Flow) and [T1499.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/004) (Endpoint Denial of Service: Application or System Exploitation).  The vulnerability also has an exploitation technique mapping of [T1548.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/001) (Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Setuid and Setgid).  The methodology does not list T1548.001 as an exploitation technique because it is relatively rare.
